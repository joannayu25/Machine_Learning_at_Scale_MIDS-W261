    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop MapReduce is based on the functional programming paradigm. The main ideas of functional programming is 1) higher order functions, where functions can take other functions as inputs. MapReduce exemplifies this in that both Map and Reduce are essentially higher order functions that take other functions to do the mapping and reducing. 2) maintaining statelessness, which means no data state is changed, which is evident in MapReduce since there is no shared mutable information that MapReduce will need in order to do parallel processing. [source: live session week2 demo]\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Shuffling is the synchronization that happens before reducing. Multiple processes will need to join up to share intermediate results or exchange state information, such as grouping by key. It is potentially costly because this step involves copying intermediate data over the network. The number of intermdiate data is potentially more than the input data. We can mitigate the cost by reducing the intermediate data through in-memory combining and/or using combiners to aggregate the intermediate data before shuffling. [source: 'Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce']\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The input and output record format of a combiner script have to be the same because this is an optional optimization step that occurs between the mappers and reducers. It should not change the correctness of the algorithm and only perform local aggregation of intermediate data from the mapper without changing the record format.[source: 'Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce']\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ I can control the level of parallelization by 1) suggesting the number of mappers to run in parallel, but Hadoop will split the file based on the size of the resulting block. 2) since each input file will be assigned to a mapper, the input data can be divided into desired number of files to control how many mappers will be used. But if the files are too big, they will be split further by HDFS. 3) specifying the number of reducers, but the number should be sufficiently large so each reducer will not crash the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The beginning of the multi-core era and commodity hardware prompted the creation of parallel computation frameworks like Hadoop. The semiconductor industry hit a point of diminishing returns on improving components in the single core system (faster clocks, deeper pipelines, superscalar architecture, etc) and that marked the beginning of multi-core era. As the price comes down, commodity hardware allows for the scaling out of parallel processing of large data. [source: 'Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce']"

    "> __a)__ Counters are used to count events that occur during execution. The built-in counter allows us to see how many records are emitted. We can create a custom counter by writing to the standard error stream to track any events in the mapper, combiner, or reducer. It can also increment only in certain situations if we put it inside an if statement. Custom counters are helpful in determining if we have a load balancing issue. [source: week3 demo]\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ A composite key is a an intermediate key where we move part of the value into the key. This allows us to do a combination of partitioning and sorting using data beyond just the key. Custom partitioning can be done on the key while we can then specify an arbitrary number of additional sorting (such as secondary or tertiary sort) based on different values in the composite key. This way, we can have scalable sorting handled by the MapReduce framework rather than the reducer functions. [source: Data Intensive Text Processing with Map Reduce]\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The order inversion pattern is the design where the reducer can access the result of a computation before processing the data that are needed for the computation. We can emit special key-value pairs so they appear at the top once sorting is done. This way, the reducers will have access to the special key-value pair, which is usually a required element in the computation reducers need to perform as additional data is streamed in. An example for the key-value pair is some form of aggregate total so the reducers can compute frequency. We are in essence converting a sequencing of computation to sorting through coordination within MapReduce. [source: Data Intensive Text Processing with Map Reduce]\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",

    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb).

    "> __a)__ A given set of files are considered in total order sort if records within each file are sorted, records across files are also sorted, and the files are also sorted. An unordered total sort is almost like a total order sort except that the files are unsorted. If records within each file are sorted, but records across files are unsorted, we have a partial sort. The total sort order allows for faster search, which is important for large datasets because such optimization will mean significant speed gain. The algorithm can be designed to take advantage of the total sort. [source: Total Order Sort Notebook]\n",

The default shuffle behavior needs to be changed to add a custom partitioner and custom sort order because this is the only way to guarantee that records across partitions are sorted. The custom partition should be carefully designed so that we can achieve Total Order Sort once we sort data in each partition and restack the partition files. [source: Total Order Sort Notebook]\n",

And since the order of the partition files are not guaranteed to be in any particular order, we must then restack the partition files in sorted order. [source: Total Order Sort Notebook]\n",

Doing so successfully requires a thorough understanding of the data size at each stage of the job. As you learned in the week3 live session, counters are an invaluable resource for understanding this kind of detail. In this question, we will take the EDA performed in Question 4 as an opportunity to illustrate some related concepts.\n",

    "* __b) code:__ Note that we wrote the reducer in question 4a such that the input and output record format is identical. This makes it easy to use the same reducer script as a combiner.

    "> __a)__ The number of records emitted by the mappers is the same as the number received by the reducers: 31490. In a word counting perspective, this would be the total number of words in the document.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> __d)__ If the data from the mappers cannot be aggregate to reduce intermediate data volume, the combiner will not have any work to do. In this problem, if all words are unique, the combiner will not be needed. In light of that, increasing the number of mappers may decrease the usefulness of a combiner because each file may potentially contain only unique words, and therefore, there is a higher chance of the combiner not being able to do any aggregation.

This represents the overall probability of $c$.  2) $\\hat{P}(t_k|c)$ for all terms in the vocabulary. $\\hat{P}(t_k|c)$ is a measure of how much evidence $t_k$ contributes that $c$ is the correct class.

We can estimate $\\hat{P}(c)$ by taking calculating the percentage of documents that are labeled as spam. We can estimate $\\hat{P}(t_k|c)$ by dividing the number of occurrences of a particular word in the spam class by the total word count in the spam class. We will need to pass over the data twice. In the first pass, we can partition the data into 2 separate classes (ham and spam) and sort the words. In the second pass, we can keep a running total of the total word count while we aggregate the counts for each unique word. \n",

    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",

This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they?

    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",

    "\n",

    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",

Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",

Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "> __a)__ The keys are the unique words in the document. The values, consisting of 4 numbers, are the number of occurrences of the word in each class (class 0 and class 1), followed the conditional probabilities in class 0 and class 1. The \"ClassPriors\" record is different from the rest because it represents information about the whole class rather than a single word. We will need the probability numbers for inference, but the number of occurrences will be useful for debugging. \n",

    "> __d)__ The in-memory join doesn't quite violate the functional programming principles. This is not exactly a shared state between processes because the model file only contains probabilities, which do not need updating. The in-memory join should not create a bottleneck or race condition. However, since each mapper will load the probabilities into memory, this only works well if the vocabulary is small. If the vocabulary is too big and/or there is a lot of mappers, memory may run out. \n",

The mappers will still look up log probabilities from the trained model and aggregate the probabilities. The key-value structure emitted would be docID and the cumulative log probabilities of the partial document being processed. The reducers would combine all the log probabilities of a particular document (with the same docID) and then check to see which class has higher probability and produce the prediction as the last step.\n"

    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example).

    "> __c)__ The Laplace smoothing requires the vocabulary count (the number of unique words).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ For option 1, if we have the total vocabulary count, we can pass it to the reducer and not need to run a second MapReduce job. However, we would need preprocessing, or a second MapReduce job, to get the vocab count in the first place. For option 2, if the vocab count is not available, it is impossible to compute the vocab count directly using 1 MapReduce job without postprocessing. Each reducer can only compute the count of unique words in its own file. Without another step to combine the count, there would be no way to add the unique word counts from each reducer together. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Given that both options require additional processing beyond a single MapReduce job, getting the vocab count ahead of time is a better option because once the vocab count is determined, there is no need to recompute that. Option 2 would require that we run MapReduce twice (or MapReduce + postprocessing step) every time we need to run or debug the job. \n"

    "Fantastic work. We're finally ready to perform Spam Classification on the Enron Corpus. In this question you'll run the analysis you've developed, report its performance, and draw some conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. \n",
    "\n",
    "[`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",

    ")]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `e`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'e'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "> __d)__ The unsmoothed version performed significantly worse. This is because this model does not handle the zero probability issue well so a lot of documents end up having zero probability, causing a lot of false negatives. This means whenever we have an unseen word, the model will not predict well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ model_sort_mapper adds two additional fields in the output, $maxClass$ and $maxClassP$. Since we now know the class the word belongs to and the corresponding probability, we can partition based on the class (using 2 partitions since we have 2 classes) and then sort by the probability. We can then print the top 10 words by printing the first 10 words from each of the 2 partition files. \n",

    "> __f)__ The top words are rather common words, not the words that would differentiate between ham and spam. If we increase K, we will increase the bias and decrease the variance of our model. This is because as K becomes bigger, the probabilities will become more similar. As K approaches infinity, the probabilities will become the same, therefore, the variance will decrease. As K increases, more errors are introduced to the model and therefore the bias is increased. "
